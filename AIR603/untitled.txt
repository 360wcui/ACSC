You have effectively highlighted the challenges posed by China’s Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS) and Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) capabilities. There are several perspectives remain unexplored. For instance, incorporating the role of cyber and space warfare, which are critical to supporting China’s strategies, would be beneficial. These domains could disrupt U.S. Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) operations, degrade communications, or compromise situational awareness. Covering these domains would offer a more comprehensive analysis.

Additionally, the vulnerabilities within U.S. systems are not explored, such as dependence on GPS, electronic warfare countermeasures, and logistical challenges in the Indo-Pacific region. These weaknesses could significantly impact SEAD effectiveness and deserve attention. Futhermore, the sustainability of SEAD operations, given the resource-intensive nature of such missions, is another important factor to consider. Prolonged engagement in the region would strain our financial resources and logistical capacities, an issue that must be addressed strategically. Finally, collaboration with allies is essential.  There are potential barriers to integration, such as interoperability issues. 

Overall, you have done a great job.  The analysis would benefit from a more comprehensive examination and U.S. countermeasures across multiple domains.
